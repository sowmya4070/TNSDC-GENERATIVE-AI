# Handwritten Digit Model using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating handwritten digits. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and can generate realistic handwritten digits resembling those in the dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/handwritten-digit-gan.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the training script to train the GAN model:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```
   This will start the training process, during which the model will learn to generate handwritten digits.

2. Once the training is complete, you can generate new handwritten digits using the trained model:
   ```
   python generate_digits.py
   ```
   This will generate and display new handwritten digits.
